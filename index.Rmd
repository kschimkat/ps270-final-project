## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to... 
- The election
- Healthcare: healthcare inequality
- Public health: Maybe chronic disease & food additives? I've always been interested in exploring topics related to public health and think exploring related data would be really interesting & beneficial to have as a project.
